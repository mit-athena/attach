.SH NAME
attachandrun - attach a filesystem and run a program from it

.SH SYNOPSIS
attachandrun locker program argv0 [argv1 ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIattachandrun\fR combines the operations of attaching a locker,
locating its binary directory, and executing a program out of that
directory. Running a program via \fIattachandrun\fR should be
indistinguishable from running it out of its locker by hand. A typical
``attach and run'' script would look like:

    #!/bin/sh
.br
    exec /tmp/attachandrun moira blanche "$0" "$@"

.SH NOTE
The programs \fIadd(1)\fP, \fIattach(1)\fP, \fIattachandrun(1)\fP,
\fIdetach(1)\fP, \fInfsid(1)\fP, and \fIzinit(8)\fP are all really the
same program.  Typically \fIattachandrun\fR, \fIdetach(1)\fP,
\fInfsid(1)\fP and \fIzinit(8)\fP (but not \fIadd(1)\fP) are links to
\fIattach\fP.  Argv[0] is used to determine which one of the programs
is run.  This may be overridden by specifying -P \fIprogname\fP, where
\fIprogname\fP should be one of the above five program names.
