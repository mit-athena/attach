.SH NAME
attachandrun \- attach a filesystem and run a program from it

.SH SYNOPSIS
attachandrun [--check] locker program argv0 [argv1 ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIattachandrun\fR combines the operations of attaching a locker,
locating its binary directory, and executing a program out of that
directory. Running a program via \fIattachandrun\fR should be
indistinguishable from running it out of its locker by hand. A typical
``attach and run'' script would look like:

.nf
    #!/bin/sh
    exec /bin/athena/attachandrun moira blanche "$0" "$@"
.fi

If you specify the \fI--check\fR option, \fIattachandrun\fR will check
for the existence of the binary but not actually run it. (In this
case, you don't need to specify any argv elements.) It will exit with
status 0 if the binary exists, or 1 if it does not. Note that a
successful exit status does not necessarily mean that attempting to
run the binary will succeed: it indicates only that the file exists.
