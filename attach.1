.TH ATTACH 1
.SH NAME
attach \- attach a remote file system to your workstation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 8
attach
[-v | -q | -p] [-z | -h] locker ...
.PP
.nf
attach -l \fIfilesystem\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I attach
is a filesystem-independent utility which allows you attach a
filesystem to a directory hierarchy on your workstation. Currently,
the only supported filesystem type is AFS.

.B NOTE: 
.I attach 
is provided mainly for compatibility with previous versions of Athena.
With Debathena, \fI/mit\fP is auto-mounted, so you can access any path
under \fI/mit\fP without explicitly attaching the locker.

Attach looks up the \fIfilesystem\fP in
.BR Hesiod (3)
to retrieve the file system type, the server host, the name by which
the file system is known to the server (e.g., an NFS server
mountpoint), and the default mount point and mode (read-only,
read-write). 

By default,
.I attach
will attempt to make sure the user is authenticated to the remote
filesystem, by getting tokens in the appropriate cell for an AFS
locker.

The following arguments to \fIattach\fP modify its behavior. Default
options are marked as such. Unless otherwise marked, all arguments are
processed \fIin order\fP. Thus, if a -v option is followed by a -q
option, the -q option will take precedence (for any lockers that
appear after the -q on the command line). The long and short forms of
each option function identically.

If no arguments are given to \fIattach\fP, a list of the currently
attached filesystems will be printed.

.TP 8
.I --verbose (-v)
Display verbose information about a mounted filesystem, such as the
AFS path or NFS server and the server's filesystem name, if the attach
is successful. This is the default. Use of this option automatically
supresses the --printpath option.
.TP 8
.I --quiet (-q)
Don't display verbose information.  Error messages will still be printed.
.TP 8
.I --printpath (-p)
\fIattach\fP normally prints a status message on its standard output
indicating the success or failure of the attach operation. This flag
causes the pathname of the mounted filesystem to be printed instead.
This was used by the old "add" aliases. Use of this option
automatically surpresses the -verbose option.
.TP 8
.I --zephyr (-z)
Subscribe to
.BR Zephyr (1)
messages about the server host.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.I --nozephyr (-h)
Don't subscribe to
.BR Zephyr (1)
messages about the server host.
.PP
If the default mount-point for a filesystem (or the mount-point
specified with the -m option) does not exist, it is created.  Any
directories in the path that do not exist are also created.  If a
directory can't be created, the attach fails.  When the filesystem is
detached, any directories that were created during the attach are
deleted, if possible.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If \fIattach\fP is unable to initalize the locker library, it will
exit with status 1. If \fIattach\fP encounters a problem attaching a
locker, it will continue trying to attach any remaining lockers on the
command line, but eventually exit with status 2.
