.SH NAME
zinit \- zephyr login initialization program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zinit
[-a] [-d] [-m] [-q] [-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zinit
is normally executed automatically \fIzwgc(1)\fR.  It reads through
\fIattachtab\fR(5) to determine which filesystems have been
attached on that workstation, and subscribes the user to the
appropriate Zephyr instances so that he or she will receive
messages from Athena Operations regarding the filesystems'
fileservers. 

\fIZinit\fR subscribes to class \fBFILSRV\fR, instances \fIservername\fR and
\fIservername\fR:\fIfilesystem\fR or \fIservername\fR:\fIpathname\fR for remote
NFS and RVD filesystems found in attachtab, where \fIservername\fR is the
name of the machine providing the file service.  For type AFS filesystems,
instances afs:\fIcell\fR:\fIvolume\fR and afs:\fIcell\fR are subscribed to,
where \fIcell\fR and \fIvolume\fR are the cell and volume names of the
root of the filesystem.  In addition, if the root of an AFS filesystem is
not replicated on multiple servers, instance afs:\fIservername\fB is
subscribed to.

By default, only messages about
filesystems attached by the user running attach or root are subscribed to.
The
.B \-a
option selects all remote filesystems, while
.B \-m
selects only those attached by the user.
.BR \-q ,
.BR \-d ,
and
.B  \-v
have the same meaning as in \fIattach(1)\fR.

.SH NOTE
The programs \fIadd(1)\fP, \fIattach(1)\fP, \fIattachandrun(1)\fP,
\fIdetach(1)\fP, \fInfsid(1)\fP, and \fIzinit(8)\fP are all really the
same program.  Typically \fIattachandrun\fR, \fIdetach(1)\fP,
\fInfsid(1)\fP and \fIzinit(8)\fP (but not \fIadd(1)\fP) are links to
\fIattach\fP.  Argv[0] is used to determine which one of the programs
is run.  This may be overridden by specifying -P \fIprogname\fP, where
\fIprogname\fP should be one of the above five program names.
