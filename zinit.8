.TH ZINIT 8 "July 18, 1989" "MIT Project Athena"
.ds ]W MIT Project Athena
.SH NAME
zinit \- zephyr login initialization program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zinit
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zinit
is normally executed automatically \fIzwgc(1)\fR.  It reads through
the /usr/tmp/attachtab file to determine which filesystems have been
attached on that workstation, and subscribes the user to the
appropriate Zephyr instances so that he or she will receive
messages from Athena Operations regarding the filesystems'
fileservers. 

\fIZinit\fR subscribes to class \fBFILSRV\fR, instances "{servername}" and
"{servername}:filesystem" or "{servername}:pathname" for remote
filesystem found in attachtab, where {servername} is the name of the
machine providing the file service.  

.SH NOTE
The programs \fIattach(1)\fR, \fIdetach(1)\fR, \fInfsid(1)\fR, and
\fIzinit(8)\fR are all really the same program.  Typically
\fIdetach(1)\fR, \fInfsid(1)\fR and \fIzinit(8)\fR are links to
\fIattach\fR.  Argv[0] is used to determine which one of the four
programs are run.  This may be overridden by specifying -P
\fIprogname\fR, where \fIprogname\fR should be one of the above four
program names.
