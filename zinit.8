.SH NAME
zinit \- zephyr login initialization program
.SH SYNOPSIS
zinit [-a] [-m]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zinit
is normally executed automatically by \fIzwgc(1)\fR. It reads through
the attachtab to determine which filesystems have been attached on
that workstation, and subscribes the user to the appropriate Zephyr
instances so that he or she will receive messages from Athena
Operations regarding the filesystems' fileservers.

\fIzinit\fR subscribes to class \fBFILSRV\fR, instances
\fIservername\fR and \fIservername\fR:\fIpathname\fR for NFS lockers
found in attachtab, where \fIservername\fR is the name of the machine
providing the file service. For AFS filesystems, instances \fIcell\fR,
and \fIcell\fR:\fIvolume\fR are subscribed to, where \fIcell\fR and
\fIvolume\fR are the cell and volume names of the root of the
filesystem. In addition, if the root of an AFS filesystem is not
replicated on multiple servers, instance \fIservername\fP is
subscribed to.

By default, only messages about filesystems attached by the user
running attach or root are subscribed to. The
.B \-a \fPor\fB \-\-all
option selects all remote filesystems, while
.B \-m \fPor\fB \-\-me
selects only those attached by the user.
