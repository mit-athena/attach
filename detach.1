.TH DETACH 1
.SH NAME
detach \- detach a remote file system from your workstation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
detach [-v | -q] [-y | -n] [-z | -h] [-x | -e] [-O] filesystem ...
detach [options] mountpoint ...
detach [options] [-t type] [-C] [-a | -H host ...]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I detach
performs the appropriate filesystem-dependent operations to
disassociate a filesystem which was attached using
.BR attach (1)
from the workstation.

The \fI-a\fP form is used to detach all attached filesystems from the
workstation. This is typically run when the workstation reactivates,
so as to flush all user mounted filesystems from the workstation.

The following options are available in
.I detach\fP:

.TP 8
.I --verbose (-v)
Display verbose information about the success of the detach.  This is
the default.
.TP 8
.I --quiet (-q)
Don't display verbose information.
.TP 8
.I --all (-a)
Attempt to detach all filesystems which had been attached using the
\fIattach\fP command.
.TP 8
.I --unmap (-y)
Attempt to remove authentication for the user from the filesystem
server.  The authentication will be removed even if the detach fails.
This is the default.
.TP 8
.I --nomap (-n)
Do not attempt to remove authentication for the user from the
filesystem server.
.TP 8
.I --zephyr (-z)
Remove \fIZephyr\fP subscription information about the server host.
This is the default.
.TP 8
.I --nozephyr (-h)
Don't remove \fIZephyr\fP subscription information about the server host.
.TP 8
.I --type \fIfilesystem-type\fP (-t \fIfilesystem-type\fP)
Used with the --all option to detach all filesystems of a particular
type.  If not specified, the --all option will detach all filesystems.
.TP 8
.I --explicit (-e)
Change the behavior of \fIdetach\fP such that the \fIfilesystem\fP is
now interpreted as \fIhost:directory\fP (in the case of NFS) or
\fIhost:pack\fP (in the case of RVD) instead of as a Hesiod name.
Type --type option can be used to specify the filesystem type.
.TP 8
.I --noexplicit (-x)
Tell \fIdetach\fP to interpret the \fIfilesystem\fP as a Hesiod name.
This is the default.
.TP 8
.I --override (-O)
This option allows the trusted users to force a filesystem to be
detached, even if it was attached by another user or locked.
.TP 8
.I --host \fIhost\fP (-H \fIhost\fP)
Requests detach to detach all remote filesystems whose fileserver
matches the specified host.
.TP 8
.I --clean (-C)
This option indicates that the specified filesystems should be detached
if they are not wanted by anyone who is in \fI/etc/passwd\fP.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If \fIdetach\fP is unable to initalize the locker library, it will
exist with status 1. If \fIdetach\fP encounters a problem detaching a
locker, it will continue trying to detach any remaining lockers on the
command line, but eventually exit with status 2. (This does not apply
to \fIdetach -a\fP or \fIdetach -H\fP, which will exit with status 0
if they successfully detach any locker.)
