.SH NAME
(n)fsid \- Perform authorization functions to remote file servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
fsid [-q | -v] [-m | -p | -r | -u] [ filesystem | host ] ...
fsid [-q | -v] [-m | -p | -r | -u] -f filesystem ...
fsid [-q | -v] [-m | -p | -r | -u] -h host ...
fsid [-q | -v] [-m      |      -u] -c cell ...
fsid [-q | -v] [-m | -p | -r | -u] -a
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIfsid\fP is used to authenticate to remote filesystems that have
been brought local with
.BR attach (1)\fP.
.PP
If no option specifying otherwise is given, you may pass either
filesystems or hostnames on the command line.
.PP
The following arguments to \fIfsid\fP modify its default behavior.
All arguments are processed \fIin order\fP.  Thus, if a -u option is
followed by a -m option, the -m option will take precedence.

.TP 8
.I --verbose (-v)
Display verbose information about the mapping operation.  This is the
default.
.TP 8
.I --quiet (-q)
Don't display verbose information.
.TP 8
.I --map (-m)
Set the mapping function to "map user". This is the default, and
is used to authenticate a user to a filesystem or server using
Kerberos.
.TP 8
.I --unmap (-u)
Set the mapping function to "unmap user".  This is used to remove an
authentication mapping.
.TP 8
.I --purge (-p)
Set the mapping function to "purge host".  This is used to remove all
mappings associated with the user's host from the remote server. This
option may only be used by trusted users. (This only has any effect
for NFS servers.)
.TP 8
.I --purgeuser (-r)
Set the mapping function to "purge user".  This is used to remove all
mappings associated with the user on the host.  It requires that the
user have Kerberos tickets. (This only has any effect for NFS
servers.)
.TP 8
.I --filsys (-f)
Perform the current mapping operation for the servers associated with
the indicated filesystems.
.TP 8
.I --cell \fIcell\fP (-c \fIcell\fP)
Authenticate the user to the specified AFS cell.
.TP 8
.I --host \fIhost\fP (-h \fIhost\fP)
Authenticate the user to the specified NFS server host.
.TP 8
.I --all (-a)
Perform the current mapping operation for all filesystems in the
attachtab.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If \fIfsid\fP is unable to initalize the locker library, it will exist
with status 1. If \fIfsid\fP encounters a problem performing a mapping
operation, it will continue trying to work with each remaining
argument on the command line, but eventually exit with status 2. (This
does not apply to \fIfsid -a\fP, which will exit with status 0 if it
successfully maps any locker or host.)
