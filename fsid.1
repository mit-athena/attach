.SH NAME
fsid, nfsid \- Perform authorization functions to remote file servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
fsid [ options ] [[-f] filesystem ...] [-h host] [-c cell] ...
nfsid [ options ] [-f filesystem] [[-h] host ...] [-c cell] ...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIFsid\fP is a system program which presents your credentials to an
NFS server by the use of Kerberos authentication, allowing your
workstation to access files on the server.  Within Athena, the default
permissions for a client workstation attempting to access an NFS
filesystem are those of the user "nobody", meaning that a program
running on the workstation ordinarily would not be allowed to modify
any files on the NFS server.  \fIFsid\fP sends a Kerberos
authentication ticket over to the server which records an association
between a workstation's IP address and the user's userid.

.PP
The following arguments to \fIfsid\fP modify its default behavior.
All arguments are processed \fIin order\fP.  Thus, if a -u option is
followed by a -m option, the -m option will take precedence.

.IP "-verbose or -v"
Display verbose information about the mapping operation.  This is the
default.
.IP "-quiet or -q"
Don't display verbose information.
.IP "-debug or -d"
Print debugging information.  This will not normally be useful to users.
.IP "-map or -m"
Set the mapping function to "map user".  This is the default, and is
used to establish a mapping to a server.  It requires that the user be
authenticated.
.IP "-unmap or -u"
Set the mapping function to "unmap user".  This is used to remove a
mapping from a server.
.IP "-purge or -p"
Set the mapping function to "purge host".  This is used to remove all
mappings associated with the user's host.
.IP "-purgeuser or -r"
Set the mapping function to "purge user".  This is used to remove all
mappings associated with the user on the host.  It requires that the
user be authenticated.
.IP "-filsys or -f"
Perform the current mapping operation for the servers associated with
the indicated filesystems.  The filesystems are retrieved from
/var/athena/attachtab.
.IP "-cell \fIcell\fP or -c \fIcell\fP"
Authenticate the user to the specified AFS cell.
.IP "-host \fIhost\fP or -h \fIhost\fP"
Authenticate the user to the specified NFS server host.
.IP "-all or -a"
Perform the current mapping operation for all hosts associated with
filesystems in /var/athena/attachtab (see \fIattach(1)\fP).  Note that
a host may be referenced more than once if more than once filesystem
is located on that host.
.IP "-user \fIuser\fP or -U \fIuser\fP"
Perform the mapping on behalf of the specified user.

.PP
If the -f option is not specified, \fIfsid\fP takes a list of hosts
(either names or internet addresses) as arguments and performs the
specified mapping function.  If -f is specified, it takes a list of
filesystem names instead and uses /var/athena/attachtab to retrieve
the server associated with each filesystem.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
fsid -m CHARON.MIT.EDU -u -f x11
.fi

Establish a mapping for the user on the host CHARON.MIT.EDU and
delete a mapping for the user on the host the holds the x11 filesystem.

.nf
fsid -q -p -a
.fi

Purge the host's mappings on all servers that have filesystems mounted
on the host, but don't display a message after each host is purged.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

If \fIfsid\fP is executed with only a single filesystem or host
argument, the exit status will be one of the following:
.TP 5
0
No error encountered.
.TP 5
1
Bad arguments.
.TP 5
3
Internal fatal error.
.TP 5
10
Keberos failure.
.TP 5
11
Host communication failure.
.TP 5
12
Authentication failure.
.TP 5
13
No reserved ports available.
.TP 5
20
A filesystem specified with -f was not attached.
.TP 5
21
A hostname couldn't be resolved.
.PP
If more than one filesystem argument is specified, the exit status can
be either 0, 1, or 3 as listed above, or:
.TP 5
2
Something went wrong with one of the hosts or filesystems.
.PP
If an error is encountered while manipulating one filesystem in the
list, \fIfsid\fP continues with the other filesystems and returns
the exit status 2 after attempting to map or unmap all the other
filesystems. 

.SH NOTE
The programs \fIadd(1)\fP, \fIattach(1)\fP, \fIattachandrun(1)\fP,
\fIdetach(1)\fP, \fInfsid(1)\fP, and \fIzinit(8)\fP are all really the
same program.  Typically \fIattachandrun\fR, \fIdetach(1)\fP,
\fInfsid(1)\fP and \fIzinit(8)\fP (but not \fIadd(1)\fP) are links to
\fIattach\fP.  Argv[0] is used to determine which one of the programs
is run.  This may be overridden by specifying -P \fIprogname\fP, where
\fIprogname\fP should be one of the above five program names.
