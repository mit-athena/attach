.TH ATTACHTAB 5  "February, 22, 1988"
.SH NAME
attachtab \- attached filesystem table
.SH DESCRIPTION
Attach maintains an printable text database of all successful attaches
in the \fIattachtab\fR.  It uses this file to determine the current status
of a filesystem (attached, being attached, being detached) and to
retrieve information about it.  The following information is stored in
/usr/tmp/attachtab:

A version number
.br
An explicit flag
.br
The status of the filesystem (attached, being attached, or being detached).
.br
The type of the filesystem (e.g., NFS, RVD, etc.).
.br
The \fIHesiod\fR name of the filesystem (or the explicit name when
-explicit is specified).
.br
The name of the server on which the filesystem is located, if the
filesystem is on a remote host.
.br
The server's pathname or RVD locker name for the filesystem.
.br
The internet address of the server.
.br
The number of directories that had to be created to make the
mount point.
.br
The mount point pathname.
.br
The RVD driver number (if the filesystem is of type RVD).
.br
The userid of the user who attached the filesystem
.br
A flags field.  If the lowest bit is set, the the filesystem was
mounted with the nosuid option set.
.br
The mode (r or w) of the filesystem.

\fIAttach\fR and \fIdetach\fR also communicate via temporary files in
/tmp.  These files are used to determine whether or not the status
field of /usr/tmp/attachtab is accurate.  For example, if an \fIattach\fR
is aborted for some reason, /usr/tmp/attachtab may still indicate that the
filesystem is in the process of being attached.  These files are named
/tmp/attach.\fIfilesystem\fR, and are deleted as soon as they are no
longer needed.  An advisory lock is kept by the active process on the
file to indicate that a process really is operating on the filesystem.

.SH FILES
The location of attachtab can be dynamically configured in /etc/attach.conf;
by default it is located in /usr/tmp/attachtab.  It is also commonly
placed in /etc/attachtab or /site/etc/attachtab.
