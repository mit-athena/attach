.TH ADD 1
.SH NAME
add \- attach a filesystem, add it to your path and manpath

.SH SYNOPSIS
add [-f] [-r] [-q] [-w] [-a \fIattachopts\fP] filesystemname filesystemname ...

add [-f] [-r] pathname pathname ...

add [-p]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIadd\fR is an alias provided by the standard Athena dotfiles.  It is
intended to make the process of using software that is stored in
remote filesystems easier.  In normal use, it requires one argument,
the name of a filesystem to \fIadd\fR.  In that case, it adds the
appropriate binary directory (arch/sun4x_56/bin, decmipsbin, etc.) to
the end of your command search path so that you can find programs in
the locker, and adds the man directory to your MANPATH so that
\fIman\fR can find manpages that may be installed in that filesystem.
In addition, if no binary directory matches the current system, the
\fIATHENA_SYS_COMPAT\fR environment variable (see below) may be
consulted for a list of compatible binary directories.  (See
.BR lockers (7)
for suggestions on how to organize and maintain
lockers.)

A pathname (starting with a ``.'' or ``/'') may be specified in place
of a filesystem name. In this case, the string is added directly to
the path rather than being interpreted as a lockername and resolved
into a pathname. Note that filesystem names and pathnames may not be
mixed in a single invocation of add.

When no arguments are used, \fIadd\fR will print out the (possibly
abbreviated) value of the user's PATH variable. This is equivalent to
specifying the \fI-v\fR option.

\fIadd\fR may also take multiple filesystem arguments. In this case,
\fIadd locker1 locker2 locker3\fR is functionally equivalent to,
though more efficient than, \fIadd locker1; add locker2; add
locker3\fR. Thus when adding lockers to the front of your PATH, they
will appear as \fIlocker3 locker2 locker1\fR at the front of your
PATH.

\fIadd\fR may be used interactively while logged in, or in your
~/.environment file.

Typing "alias add" in your C shell will reveal that it is an alias
which evaluates the output of a special invocation of
.BR attach (1)\fP.
Note that Bourne shell output is also available.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIadd\fR accepts the following options:
.TP 9
.B \-f
\fIadd\fR normally adds lockers to the end of your path. This option
causes it to add lockers to the front of your path instead. If the
locker is already in your path but not at the front, it will be moved
there. However, when -f is used in your ~/.environment file, it does
not affect lockers already in your path.

This feature is useful when you want to cause programs in the lockers
to replace programs found in other places, such as on the system
packs. You usually want lockers added to the end of your path,
however, to prevent the possibility of locker maintainers replacing
important binaries with things you don't expect.
.TP 9
.B \-r
This option causes \fIadd\fR to remove the specified lockers or
pathnames from your path.
.TP 9
.B \-w
This option causes \fIadd\fR to warn you in the event a locker you have
asked to be added does not support your platform. A binary directory
will not be added to your PATH, but if a man directory exists it will
still be added to your MANPATH. \fIadd\fR normally says nothing in this
case. (Note that in the case of using a compatiblity mode, you will
always be warned.)
.TP 9
.B \-p
This option causes \fIadd\fR to print the contents of the user's PATH. In
the case where a path element is of the form /mit/foo/arch/$ATHENA_SYS/bin,
\fIadd\fR substitutes the string {add foo} for that path element. This
serves to shorten and make more readable the user's PATH. In addition,
if a path element is using compatibility, such as a sun4x_56 system
having a sun4x_55 directory in its path, an asterisk will be added, as
in {add foo*}.
.TP 9
.B \-P athena_path
This option is used for supporting the use of \fIadd\fR in the user's
~/.environment file. The user normally need never specify this option
as that is taken care of by a special version of the alias that is in
effect when the .environment file is run. This option is used to pass
the \fIathena_path\fR shell variable to \fIadd\fR on the command line,
and cause \fIadd\fR to modify that variable in its output instead of
the environment variable PATH as it normally does. In the C shell
case, \fIathena_path\fR is space-separated, and so must be quoted in
the shell in order to be passed to \fIadd\fR as a single argument. In
the Bourne shell case, \fIathena_path\fR is colon-separated, so this
isn't necessary.
.TP 9
.B \-a
This option causes \fIadd\fR to pass all remaining options on the command
line directly to \fIattach\fR. This is useful for passing flags meant to
be interpreted by \fIattach\fR and not by \fIadd\fR.
.TP 9
.B \-b
This option causes \fIadd\fR to produce output suitable for interpretation
by the Bourne shell. Note that this option is only intended for use by
shell aliases or subroutines which call attach directly. Using this option
explicitly on the command line with the C shell add alias will cause the
alias to fail.
.TP 9
.B \-q
This option causes \fIadd\fR to suppress warning messages given when a
platform from \fIATHENA_SYS_COMPAT\fR (see below) is added to the user's
path.
.SH VARIABLES
The shell variable \fIadd_flags\fR may be set to specify default flags
that \fIadd\fR is intended to use for all commands. For example, if
you desire that attach always give warnings for lockers that do not
have binary directories supporting your platform, you might put a
``set add_flags = "-w"'' in your ~/.cshrc.mine file.

The environment variable \fIATHENA_SYS\fR is used to determine the
sysname value when determining path names for new-style paths.

The environment variable \fIATHENA_SYS_COMPAT\fR is a colon-separated
list of fallback sysname values which are known to be generally
compatible with the current system. Thus, on a Solaris 2.6 machine,
\fIATHENA_SYS\fR may be set to sun4x_56, with \fIATHENA_SYS_COMPAT\fR
set to sun4x_55:sun4m_54. Then if there is no arch/sun4x_56 directory
available, arch/sun4x_55 will be checked, etc.

.SH NOTE
Most of the work of the \fIadd\fR alias is done by
.BR attach (1)\fR,
by giving it the option \fI-Padd\fR.

.SH BUGS
All of \fIadd\fR's visible output is sent to stderr. The stdout pipe
is use strictly for the output of commands the shell is intended to
evaluate.
